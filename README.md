## 📝 Introduction

In the realm of programming and mathematics, understanding how numbers are represented in different formats is crucial. Single-precision floating-point (float32) is one such format, widely used due to its balance between range and precision. 

The identity function is a simple yet powerful concept: it returns the same value that it receives as input. This project evaluates the identity function specifically for float32 numbers, making it easier to see how values are treated in this format.

## ✨ Features

- Simple and effective evaluation of the identity function.
- Supports standard single-precision floating-point numbers.
- Built in JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into your projects.
- Lightweight and straightforward code structure.

## 📥 Installation

To get started with the **number-float32-base-identity**, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amertakarsaadhinata/number-float32-base-identity.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd number-float32-base-identity
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🔧 Usage

Once installed, you can easily use the functionality provided in this repository. Here’s a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
const evaluateIdentity = require('./path-to-your-function');

// Test with a float32 number
const result = evaluateIdentity(3.14);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 3.14
```

## 💡 Examples

Here are a few more examples of how to use the identity function with various float32 numbers:

```javascript
console.log(evaluateIdentity(0.0));        // Outputs: 0.0
console.log(evaluateIdentity(-1.0));       // Outputs: -1.0
console.log(evaluateIdentity(12345678.9)); // Outputs: 12345678.9
```

Each of these calls will return the input value, demonstrating the identity function's straightforward behavior.
